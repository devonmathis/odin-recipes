    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>German chocolate cake is my absolute favorite kind of cake.
        I always ask for it on my birthday and appreciate when a good
        one is made. Many bakers don't understand that it's all about 
        the coconut and pecan frosting. Follow me along to learn how to
        make my favorite cake recipe.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the chocolate cake: Combine dry ingredients (sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, 
            baking soda and salt). Combine wet ingredients (eggs, buttermilk, 
            oil and vanilla). Mix together and stir in boiling water.</li>
        <li>Bake at 375: Pour batter into prepared 8 or 9-inch round baking pans. I like 
            to cut a round piece of wax or parchment paper for the bottom of 
            the pan also, to make sure the cake comes out easily.</li>
        <li>Make German Chocolate Frosting: Combine brown sugar, granulated sugar, butter, egg yolks, and 
            evaporated milk in a saucepan and bring the mixture to a low boil 
            over medium heat. Stir constantly until the mixture thickens. 
            Remove from heat and stir in vanilla, nuts and coconut. Allow to 
            cool completely before layering it on the cake.</li>
        <li>Make chocolate frosting: Melt butter, stir in cocoa powder, slowly add powdered sugar and 
            milk, beating to spreading consistency. Add small amount additional 
            milk, if needed to thin the frosting, or a little extra powder, until 
            you reach your desired consistency. Stir in vanilla.</li>
        <li>Assemble: Place one of the cake rounds on your serving stand or plate. 
            Smooth a thin layer of chocolate frosting over the cake layer, and then 
            spoon half of the coconut frosting on top, spreading it into a smooth layer. 
            Leave about Â½ inch between the filling and edge of cake.  Stack the second cake 
            round on top. Smooth chocolate frosting over the entire cake. Spoon remaining 
            coconut frosting on top of the cake.</li>
    </ol>
